        <h2>Tips on reducing waste and conserving resources</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>he three R's reduce, reuse and recycle all help to cut down on the amount of waste we throw away.</li>
            <li>The three R's conserve natural resources, landfill space and energy. Plus, the three R's save land
                 and money communities must use to dispose of waste in landfills.</li>
                 <li>You don't need to buy new items to adopt a zero waste lifestyle.
                     Check around your home for what you already have that can minimise wastage.</li>
                     <li>Always opt for reusable items especially bags. Studies show that an estimated
                         500 billion to 1 trillion plastic bags are consumed worldwide every year.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2><u>REDUCE:</u></h2>
        <h3>The best way to manage waste is to not produce it. This can be done by shopping carefully and being aware of a few guidelines:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Buy products in bulk. Larger, economy-size products or ones in concentrated form use less packaging and usually cost less per ounce.</li>
    <li>Avoid over-packaged goods, especially ones packed with several materials such as foil, paper, and plastic. They are difficult to recycle, plus you pay more for the package.</li>
    <li>Avoid disposable goods, such as paper plates, cups, napkins, razors, and lighters. Throwaways contribute to the problem, and cost more because they must be replaced again and again.</li>
    <li>Buy durable goods - ones that are well-built or that carry good warranties. They will last longer, save money in the long run and save landfill space.</li>
    <li>At work, make two-sided copies when ever possible.</li>
    <li>Maintain central files rather than using several files for individuals.</li>
    <li>Use electronic mail or main bulletin board.</li>
    <li>Remove your name from the mailing lists of materials you no longer want to receive: write to Mail Preference Service, c/o Direct Marketing Assoc., P.O. Box 90008, Farmingdale, NY 11735.</li>
     <li> Use cloth napkins instead of paper napkins.</li>
        <li>Use a dish cloth instead of paper towels.</li>
    </ul> 
    <h2><u>REUSE:</u></h2> 
    <h3>It makes economic and environmental sense to reuse products. Sometimes it takes creativity:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Reuse products for the same purpose. Save paper and plastic bags, and repair broken appliances, furniture and toys.</li>
         <li>Reuse products in different ways. Use a coffee can to pack a lunch; use plastic microwave dinner trays as picnic dishes.</li>
        <li>Sell old clothes, appliances, toys, and furniture in garage sales or ads, or donate them to charities.</li>
           <li> Use reseal able containers rather than plastic wrap.</li>
          <li>Use a ceramic coffee mug instead of paper cups.</li>
         <li> Reuse grocery bags or bring your own cloth bags to the store. Do not take a bag from the store unless you need one.</li>
    </ul>  
            <h2><u>RECYCLE:</u></h2>
        <h3>Recycling is a series of steps that takes a used material and processes, remanufactures, and sells it as a new product. Begin recycling at home and at work:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Buy products made from recycled material. Look for the recycling symbol or ask store managers or salesmen. The recycling symbol means one of two things â€“ either the product is made of recycled material, or the item can be recycled. For instance, many plastic containers have a recycling symbol with a numbered code the identifies what type of plastic resin it is made from. However, just because the container has this code does not mean it can be easily recycled locally.</li>
<li>Check collection centers and curbside pickup services to see what they accept, and begin collecting those materials. These can include metal cans, newspapers, paper products, glass, plastics and oil.</li>
<li>Consider purchasing recycled materials at work when purchasing material for office supply, office equipment or manufacturing.</li>
<li>Speak to store managers and ask for products and packaging that help cut down on waste, such as recycled products and products that are not over packaged.</li>
<li>Buy products made from material that is collected for recycling in your community.</li>
<li>Use recycled paper for letterhead, copier paper and newsletters.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><u>Paper and Plastics:</u></h2>
    <ul>
        <li><b>Paper:</b>  Most types of paper, such as ad circulars, catalogs, carbonless paper, dry goods packaging with liners removed (example: cereal, pasta, rice, beer/soda cartons) envelopes, file folders, flattened cardboard, junk mail, magazines, newspapers, office paper, paperback books, paper bags, paper towel/toilet paper cores, phone books, non-metallic gift wrap.</li>
        <li><b>Plastics:</b>  Labeled #1 through #7 on the package, look for a recycling logo on the bottom or back of the container. Remove lids and rinse. Examples: beverage bottle, shampoo and lotion bottles, meat trays, condiment bottles, prescription and medicine bottles.</li>
        <li><b>Glass Bottles and Jars All Colors:</b>  Remove lids and rinse all food and liquids. Examples: beverage bottles, food and condiment bottles and jars (jelly, mustard, mayonnaise).</li>
        <li><b>Metal Cans:</b> Aluminum, steel and tin beverage and food cans, rinse all food or liquids, aerosol cans, empty and remove nozzle, baking tins, rinse and remove remaining food.</li>
