            <p>
                Segregation of waste refers to the process of separating different types of waste materials based on their composition and characteristics, in order to facilitate their recycling, composting or disposal. The goal of waste segregation is to minimize the amount of waste that ends up in landfills and to promote the recycling of materials that can be used again. This helps to conserve natural resources, reduce the environmental impact of waste disposal, and support the development of a more sustainable society.
            </p>
            <p>Typically, the following types of waste are separated for disposal or recycling:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Organic waste such as food waste, yard waste, and agricultural waste.</li>
                <li>Recyclable materials such as paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, and meta</li>
                <li>Hazardous waste such as batteries, electronic waste, chemicals, and medical waste.</li>
                <li>Residual waste, which is the waste that remains after segregation and cannot be recycled or composted.</li>
                
            </ol>

            <p>Effective waste segregation requires the active participation of individuals, households, and communities, as well as the implementation of appropriate policies and infrastructure by local authorities. </p>
        <p>The three colors of waste segregation typically refer to a system used in many countries to help individuals and households separate their waste into different categories. The colors used in this system are:</p>
        
            <ol>
                <li><b>Green</b>: This color is used to represent organic waste, such as food waste, yard waste, and agricultural waste. This type of waste can be composted to produce organic fertilizer. </li>
                <li><b>Blue</b>: This color is used to represent recyclable materials, such as paper, cardboard, plastic, glass, and metal. These materials can be collected, sorted, and processed for reuse in new products. </li>
                <li><b>Red</b>: This color is used to represent hazardous waste, such as batteries, electronic waste, chemicals, and medical waste. This type of waste requires special handling and disposal, as it may pose a threat to human health and the environment if not managed properly.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>In some countries, additional colors may be used to represent additional categories of waste, such as yellow for packaging waste, or black for residual waste. The important thing is to follow the guidelines and instructions provided by local authorities to ensure that waste is properly segregated and disposed of.</p>
