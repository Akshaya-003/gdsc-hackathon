    <p>Sustainable development refers to a type of economic and social growth that meets the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. In other words, it is a way of developing and improving our societies and economies that takes into account the long-term impact on the environment and resources. This can be achieved through the use of renewable resources, reducing waste and pollution, and promoting equality and social justice. By focusing on sustainable development, we can build a better future for ourselves and the planet.</p>
